There are two modules in this folder:
1. Load Balancer
2. Firewall

Steps to run the firewall.py code:

1. Refer to this link to download and setup the Floodlight VM which comes pre-installed with Mininet.
	https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/8650780/Floodlight+VM

2. The code requires floodlight version 1.2, which is not available in the VM. After installing floodlight VM, download floodlight V1.2 from this link
	http://www.projectfloodlight.org/download/

3. Change to the directory where floodlight V1.2 is installed and run the following in one terminal to start floodlight
	java -jar target/floodlight.jar


4. In another terminal, run the following command to start mininet
	make
	sudo mn --custom topology.py --topo mytopo --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653

5. Run 'pingall' inside mininet to check if all packets are being sent to all hosts. (There should be no 'X' indicating a packet drop)

6. In another terminal execute the firewall code by typing the following with specified source and destination IP addresses and an 'allow' flag to enable or disable the flow.
 For example: python firewall.py --src_ip=10.0.0.1 --dst_ip=10.0.0.3 --allow=1

7. From the terminal that is running mininet, type xterm <src host>, say h1. This opens a new xterm terminal.

8. Inside the xterm terminal type ping <dst IP address>, say 10.0.0.3

9. Based on the value of allow, you will observe that the corresponding flow will either allow packets or disallow packets to be sent from source to destination.
